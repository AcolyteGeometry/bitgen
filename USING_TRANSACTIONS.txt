Creating transactions
=====================

Raw transactions are created using the bitgen "transaction" command, 
for example:

$ bitgen transaction 2364782648723648726384762837462873648273648726348723648726348762 0 L4mTKgeZ6XTkaFkwhhTFMw8aBUpVQeusEWYe49etscFMxq23UY7J 10.0 out 1C4VZGHQk1AXQghBR8d38bsHZf1mznMszM 9.999

First the inputs are listed, followed by the keyword "out", 
followed by the outputs. 

The inputs are given by four items:

1. Tx hash
2. Tx index
3. Private key (wif)
4. Input amount

If the private key is prefixed with an undescore ("_"), 
an old-style pay-to-pubkey is assumed. 

The input amount must be given, but can be specified as 0. 
The value is not used in the transaction, but is used to
calculate the supplied fee. If the value is not correct or zero, 
the fee calculation will be incorrect. However, 
this will not change the raw transaction that is created.

Any number of inputs can be specified (but at least one)

The outputs are specified by two items:
1. Address
2. Amount

The Amount is the value the will be specified in the raw transaction.

The address is normally an address, but can also be specifed as
"OP_RETURN". In this case no amount should be given, 
instead a string for inclusion in the block chain should be given.

Any number of outputs can be specified (but at least one)

Here are som other examples of a valid transactions:

$ bitgen transaction 2364782648723648726384762837462873648273648726348723648726348762 0 _L4mTKgeZ6XTkaFkwhhTFMw8aBUpVQeusEWYe49etscFMxq23UY7J 10.0 out 1C4VZGHQk1AXQghBR8d38bsHZf1mznMszM 9.999 OP_RETURN "This is a test"
