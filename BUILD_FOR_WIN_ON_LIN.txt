Building bitgen for Windows using Linux
=======================================

This document describes how to cross-compile bitgen for Windows
using Ubuntu Linux. The end result is Windows exe-files, 
but Windows is not used during the build process, only Linux. 
The dollar character ($) is the Linux prompt, and the 
arrow (>) is the Windows prompt.

To build bitgen for Windows, the Mingw-w64 C++ cross-compiler is used.

In Ubuntu linux the g++ compiler can be installed 
with the following command: 

$ sudo apt-get install mingw-w64

To build the bitcoin software, use the makefile Makefile.windows:

$ make -f Makefile.windows

This will build exe-files that should be executed on a Windows PC.

Copy the files to a Windows machine and run the tests:

> bitgen test
> bitsig test
> bitcry test

Always run the tests when moving to a different platform.
